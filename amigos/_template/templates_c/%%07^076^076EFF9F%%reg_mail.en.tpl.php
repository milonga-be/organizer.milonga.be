Dear <?php echo $this->_tpl_vars['fname2']; ?>
 and <?php echo $this->_tpl_vars['fname1']; ?>
,

we are happy to welcome you to the workshop weekend with Cecilia and Andres!

The price for your <?php echo $this->_tpl_vars['nb_workshops']; ?>
 workshop(s) will be <?php echo $this->_tpl_vars['price']; ?>
 euro per person , you can pay this (in cash) just before the first workshop starts.

The address for the workshops is: ​BE-TANGO - 5 Rue Charles Demeer, 1020 Brussels ( http://goo.gl/maps/Gu5At ). We will be giving the classes in the class room downstairs.
​​
Public transport: metro station "Pannenhuis" (line 6) is at 5 minutes walking distance from BE-TANGO. When you exit the metro, go to your left, continue straight onto the roundabout, cross it and 50 meters further you will find BE-TANGO on your left.



If you are free, try to see Cecilia & Andres perform at Pianofabriek (Sunday 6 Oct). You will not regret it!

Kind regards and see you in the weekend,

Panni & Peter,
