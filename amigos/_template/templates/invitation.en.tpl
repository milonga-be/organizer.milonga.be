Dear {$fname},

You might have heard: Panni and I have invited a couple of great dancers to Brussels. Cecilia Piccinni and Andres Molina are young, spectacular dancers from Buenos Aires, witha lot of respect for the tradition of tango. We have seen them do a performance in Porec (Croatia) and the crowd went wild.

We have now invited them as the first of hopefully many "Amigos del Paparazzo" to Brussels. They will perform this weekend at Patio de Tango and Pianofabriek, and Andres, who is a resident DJ at the famous El Yeite milonga in Buenos Aires, will be the DJ at La Cellule on Friday. You can find the details on  http://agenda.milonga.be

They also give a series of workshops on Friday, Saturday and Sunday in BE-TANGO (Laken). They have lots of experience and style to share with you, and the workshops cover technique, connection as well as musicality. Please check them out at http://amigos.tangopaparazzo.com/workshops.
